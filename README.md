# review_ranker_service
Backend for [review-ranker](https://github.com/williamhelmrath/review-ranker), a product review ranking system. This is part of our final project for CS 4780: Information Retrieval.

This API does two things: tokenizes reviews via POST requests using NLTK, and proxies to an Apache Solr instance.
